# BASIC Interpreter

BASIC Interpreter provides an interactive interpreter for processing commands and BASIC code entered by the user. The
project is inspired by the tutorial series available
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK2OxjhH3dw&list=PLLfIBXQeu3aaEgJeLEcVXP6TNOCifY1CM), with the code heavily
modified to incorporate object-oriented concepts.
